                <div class="mt-4">
                    <p class="text-gray-700">A postcode is a combination of letters and numbers used to identify
                        a specific area or address. It helps the Royal Mail and other services deliver items to the
                        correct location quickly and efficiently. Every home, business, and building in the UK has its
                        unique postcode.</p>

                <div class="mt-4">
                  <p class="text-gray-700">The UK postcode format follows a standard structure. Here’s a simple breakdown of the different parts:</p>
                  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-1 mt-4 space-y-4">
                    <li class="text-gray-800">
                      <span class="font-semibold">Outward Code (First Part)</span>
                      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The first part of a postcode is called the outward code. It helps identify the town or district. The outward code usually has two parts:</p>
                      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><b>Area:</b> This is the first one or two letters, which identify the main city or region.</li>
                        <li><b>District:</b> This is the number or letter that follows, narrowing down the specific district within the area.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Example: In the postcode <b>SW1A 1AA</b>, <b>SW</b> stands for South West London, and "1A" represents the specific district.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="text-gray-800">
                      <span class="font-semibold">Inward Code (Second Part)</span>
                      <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">The second part of the postcode is called the inward code. It pinpoints the exact location within a district and usually has two parts:</p>
                      <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-2">
                        <li><b>Sector:</b> The number in the inward code refers to a smaller area or street.</li>
                        <li><b>Unit:</b> The final two letters identify a specific building or address.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">Example: In <b>SW1A 1AA</b>, <b>1AA</b> is the inward code that directs to a precise location.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
